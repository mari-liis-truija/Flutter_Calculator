# Firestore support

**Task 6:**
Please add Firestore (instead of sharedPreferences with same functionality) to your app. It should record history in the cloud.

If you can manage to limit read/write access to only the author of the record, you can get additional 5 points.

To sum up:

Adding Firestore - 7 points

Managing security rules - 5 points
