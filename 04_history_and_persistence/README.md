# History and persistence

**Task 4:**
Your calculator could remember previous activities. Please create a separate screen "History" where the app records the previous calculations. A history line should include the calculation e.g "4 * 5 = 20" and the time of the calculation e.g. "2022-10-22 15:30".

The history has to be persisted in storage. You have two options: sharedPreferences and SQLite.

SharedPreferences implementation will give you up to 8 points, while SQLite is more complicated and will give you up to 10 points.

This logic also works for task 5
